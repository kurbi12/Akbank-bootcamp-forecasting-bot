# Akbank-bootcamp-forecasting-bot
This project is a simple forecasting bot built using the Tesla stock price dataset (2010–2020) from Kaggle.  It includes exploratory data analysis (EDA), a Linear Regression model, and evaluation metrics (R², RMSE).  Future improvements may include trying Random Forest or LSTM models and deploying the project with a Streamlit UI.
